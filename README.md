# C# learnt with Excercise Projects

This repository contains small exercises that can serve
as an introduction to C#

### 01 - BlackJack
The first exercise is about creating a small command
line based blackjack game. The game has simplified
rules.

To master this exercise you will need the following
knowledge:

- Variables
- Methods
- Objects and Classes
- Loops and conditions (if, (do) while, for (each), switch)

Because our students haven't learnt as much the sample
solution does not contain:
- inheritance
- An Object Oriented Approach to implementing the game
- Getters/Setters and access restrictions to access properties
